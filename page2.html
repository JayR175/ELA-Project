    <h1>What is Social Media?</h1>
    <FONT COLOR="red">

    <p>
      Online communities, information sharing, and the ability to engage with one another are all made possible by social media platforms. Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok are a few examples.

      User-generated content is a concept that social media platforms are frequently based on, which means that users of the platform are also the ones who produce the content that is shared there. Text postings, images, moving images, and connections to other websites might all fall under this category.

      Many people now consider social media to be a vital aspect of modern life, and it has significantly changed how we exchange information and communicate. It has also had an impact on politics by giving people a forum to organize, discuss topics, and sway public opinion. However, it has also come under fire for its propensity to erode privacy and contribute to polarization of society, as well as for the dissemination of false information and fake news.
